STEEP: A SpatioTemporal Emission Estimator for Passenger vehicles

## Using GraphHopper in Python
Graphhopper is a routing API, which can be sent requests for certain route conditions and returns the computed route. 
The route calculation is thus done externally. 

In order to send requests to this API in a convenient way, an "API client" is needed, which is a library with a set of 
functions that make request and response handling easier. 
The GraphHopper provides this package in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/graphhopper/directions-api-clients-route-optimization/tree/master/python).

This API client is included in this code repository under `swagger_client/`.
